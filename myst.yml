  title: "Effects of Melatonin and Temperature on the Heart Rate of Daphnia"
  description: "This manuscript explores the effects of melatonin and reduced temperature on the heart rate of Daphnia, a model organism widely used in physiological studies. The study investigates melatonin's calming properties and Daphnia's resilience to short-term temperature changes, providing insights into their physiological responses under varying environmental conditions."
